# World_Weather_Analysis

In this project I

  1) generated 2,000 random gps coordinates
  2) made a list of the nearest city to these coordinates
  3) retreieved the weather data to all of these cities
  4) retrieved a Hotel for these cities
  5) made a heat map of any weather property I needed
  6) displayed the hotel and any other info I needed in the marker layer of google maps
  7) got directions from 1 city to 3 others, and then back. My directions map looks wrong, but it is actually right. The return route is the same as the trip (basically to and           fro)
